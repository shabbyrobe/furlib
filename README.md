Furlib: Gopher Client/Server in Go
==================================

## Expectation Management

Feel free to use this or take bits from it as you see fit (MIT license == go
nuts). I won't maintain this to any kind of standard though. This is a
scratchpad and a bit of fun for me, not a product. Issues may be responded to
whenever I happen to get around to them, but PRs are unlikely to be accepted.
